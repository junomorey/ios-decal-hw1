import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No - The values passed into the **init** function are  unwrapped optional (getting value of optional)
//: whereas the instance variables are optionals (allowed to be nil)


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {$0.characters.reversed()}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != String(reversedWords[i]) {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: It needs to be a class function because we are not calling it on an instance of Words.
//: There should not be a casting to a Strin gin line 34 since it is an array.
//: It needs to return true at the end


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: We can't use countLetters in line Y because it is not assigned to any value yet.
//: It should not be a class function because it is accessing attributes of an instance of Words.
//: It aslos needs to return true at the end so that if none of the false conditions are met it still returns a boolean value.
